# weaksimulation

SAND2022-3281 O Weak Simulation sparsifies the stabilizer decomposition of a qubit t-tensored T gate magic state to some additive error. It can accomplish this either by independent L1 sampling like in the popular SPARSIFY algorithm or with correlated L1 sampling, which offers a more efficient decomposition.
